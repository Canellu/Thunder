## How to use application

- `cd` to root directory and run `npm install`
- `cd` to `./Server` and run `npm install`
- create a `.env` file in folder `./Server` and add this line `IKEASECURITY=yoursecuritycode` (the security code is found underneath the
  IKEA Gateway)
- start application with `npm run app` then go to browser at `localhost:3000`
